## Hello World:

So this is the first in what will hopefully become a series of blog posts about testing and software development

## How I Got Here:

## Why a Blog?:

Other than the free hosting I am able to get via my GitHub account, I want to use this platform as a way of encapsulating and documenting lessons I learn on the job, in my personal side projects, and from others. Recently, I was faced with a new, exciting tech stack where documentation was sparse and the tooling was immature. Of course, this was did not stop my team from building our microservices and front-end application, the lack of established practices and industry consensus allowed us to experiement with new approaches and concepts, especially in the testing space.

## Final Thoughts:
