## Hello World:

So this is the first in a series of posts about testing / software development and anything else I happen to notice in the tech industry.
Other than making the most of the free hosting I am able to get via my GitHub account, I want to use this platform as a way of encapsulating and documenting lessons I learn on the job, in my personal side projects, and from others. Most recently, I was faced with a new, exciting tech stack where documentation was sparse and the tooling was immature. Of course, this didn't stop my team from building our micro-services and front-end applications. In fact, the lack of established practices and industry consensus allowed us to experiment with new approaches and concepts, especially in the testing space.

## About me:

Well as you have hopefully seen in the header, my name is Mason Richins. I am currently a consultant at ThoughtWorks working mostly in the QA space, though I have been able to experiment with BA and developer roles in various capacities. How did I end up here? Well, I never really thought that I would end up in software development, but I had always been passionate about computers (in my youth, it was mostly for video games). Between informal web development jobs, and building enterprise software I have been working in the industry for about 2 years and it has been at ThoughtWorks that I have really seen my technical and consulting skills' development accelerate.

## Final Thoughts:

I hope to keep to a rough cadence of at least one post a month, but I already have some posts from previous projects thought up, so hopefully there will be a good number coming through the pipes in the coming few months!
